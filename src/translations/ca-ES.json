  "seasonThreeDescription": "<p>After the painful separation from our KMMN studio, a time of reorientation began for our radio. Without a fixed location, we started to find new cooperation partners. We found a new residence, in which we planned various beer garden events in cooperation with 'Central Service Kassel e.V.' and prepared our program for the new season.</p><p>Highlight of our third season was, without question, a new edition of the 'Rundgangs-Radio'. This time in cooperation with the 'Department 06 Architecture', 'Urban and Landscape Planning' and 'Kunsthochschule Kassel' under the name 'R:ADIO R:EIN'. During an intensive period of preparation, for the first time, a wide range of talks, interviews, readings and discussions, were developed together with students and professors. In total, almost 40 hours of program with over 50 different guests from the context of art, architecture, planning and design were recorded. The tour program was rounded off by a music program curated by Radio Rasclat.</p><p>At the end of the third radio season, 'Radio Rasclat e.V.' was founded and another radio event was planned in the 'Feiertag' gallery. This time, five days of special programming await you during the Week of Museums in Kassel. In cooperation with cultural workers from the city of Kassel, contributions were prepared, there are daily program tips, as well as a colorful music program to listen to. Live from September 02 to 06, 2020, from afternoon to night.</p>",

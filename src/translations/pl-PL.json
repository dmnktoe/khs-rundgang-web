  "seasonThreeDescription": "<p>After the painful separation from our studio, a time of reorientation began for our radio.Without a fixed location, we started to find new cooperation partners and a new studio.  In the Centralservice Kassel e.V. we found a bleibe, in which we planned various beer garden events in cooperation with the Centralservice Kassel e.V. and prepared for a new season.</p><p>Highlight of the third season was without question a new edition of the Rundgangsradio, this time in cooperation with the department 06 Architecture, Urban and Landscape Planning under the name R:ADIO R:EIN. During an intensive period of preparation, a wide range of talks, interviews, readings and discussions were developed together with students for the first time. In total, almost 40 hours of program with over 50 different guests from the context of art, architecture, planning and design were created. The tour program was rounded off by a music program curated by Radio Rasclat.</p><p>At the end of the third radio season, Radio Rasclat e.V. was founded and another radio event was planned in the Feiertag gallery. This time, five days of special programming await you during the Week of Museums in Kassel. In cooperation with cultural workers from the city of Kassel, contributions were prepared, there are daily program tips, as well as a colorful music program to listen to. Live from September 02 to 06, 2020, from afternoon to night.</p>",
